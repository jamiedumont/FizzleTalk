# Fizzle London Talk
> Supporting one-page website for a talk that Jamie Dumont gave to members of the online-business community Fizzle, in London, June 2015.

## Tools Used
- Hugo (static-site generator)
- Bourbon Neat framework (CSS/SCSS organised as per ITCSS principles)
- Codekit (handling concatenation and minification of assets)

## Local development
Local development requires Codekit & Hugo.

## Deployment
Static site can be hosted anywhere, but currently sits at Netlify's CDN.

## Future Development
Site will likely be rolled into Jamie Dumont's personal site as that develops.
